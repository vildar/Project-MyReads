# MyReads Project

This project is called 'MyReads'. The books in the BooksAPI are displayed in the main page of the application in three separate categories; 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read', and 'Read'. The user is able to switch the books between those categories on the main page. Further, on clicking on the search option, the user is able to search for books via the API. The users searches are returned and they may add those books into the categories to be visible from the main page of the application.

## Using the Application

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`
